# Transfer Learning

THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN A PHOTO CAPTION GENERATING MODEL using transfer learning

for now, transfer learning is being explored by me and I have uploaded kernel.ipynb demonstrating a solution to a real world problem.

problem : need a program that takes photos as input and if the photo is rotated restores it to the proper orientation as output

resnet50 model was used
